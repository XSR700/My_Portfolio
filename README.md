Hello, my name is John Umarov. Thank you for visiting my web page design in GitHub. I created this project to expose my skills and experiences through web design. I used HTML and CSS to create an "online resume". I always push myself to be more creative and thought this idea would be a great way to explore those skills. Feel free to use my template to design your own online webpage. Hope you find it useful!
